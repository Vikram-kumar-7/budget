There is no backend server in the current version.
All data is stored locally using the browser’s localStorage.

🧩 Data Model

Each transaction follows a structured schema:

{
  id: Number,
  type: "income" | "expense",
  amount: Number,
  desc: String,
  cat: String,
  date: "YYYY-MM-DD",
  time: "HH:MM",
  recurring: Boolean
}


This schema is directly compatible with MongoDB, making backend migration straightforward.
