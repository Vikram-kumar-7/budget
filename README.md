BudgetMaster – Personal Finance & Analytics App
📌 Overview

BudgetMaster is a feature-rich, single-page personal finance application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to track income and expenses, analyze spending patterns, manage budgets, and visualize financial data through interactive charts.

The project emphasizes data modeling, client-side state management, and analytical visualizations, making it a strong foundation for future migration to a full MERN stack backend.

🎯 Key Objectives

Track income and expense transactions efficiently

Analyze financial data using aggregations and visualizations

Provide insights through dashboards, charts, and reports

Practice real-world data handling and analytics logic

Build a scalable frontend architecture ready for backend integration

🧠 Technical Architecture

This project is a client-side Single Page Application (SPA).

Charts & Reports


There is no backend server in the current version.
All data is stored locally using the browser’s localStorage.

🧩 Data Model

Each transaction follows a structured schema:

{
  id: Number,
  type: "income" | "expense",
  amount: Number,
  desc: String,
  cat: String,
  date: "YYYY-MM-DD",
  time: "HH:MM",
  recurring: Boolean
}


This schema is directly compatible with MongoDB, making backend migration straightforward.

📈 Data Science Concepts Used

Time-series aggregation

Cumulative sums (running balance)

Category-based grouping

Percentage and threshold analysis

Data transformation for visualization

⚠ Limitations (Current Version)

No authentication or multi-user support

Data stored locally (not secure or scalable)

Performance depends on browser memory

Monolithic file structure

These are intentional trade-offs for a frontend-first prototype.

🔮 Planned Enhancements

Migrate persistence to MongoDB

Build REST APIs using Node.js & Express

Add JWT-based authentication

Introduce advanced analytics (monthly trends, predictions)

Modularize frontend code

Deploy full MERN stack version
